Don't be afraid to play slow and not hit the shield [[Attack shield indirectly]]
Use light/medium shield to prevent pokes on platforms or if he is using fair
Laser ftilt in situations I would wanna laser dair, mid to short range
Morsecode is really looking to catch a dair approach where you try to hit him in the place he's currently standing
