When you fthrow someone off stage with marth in the corner and they hold in you can fsmash them. They have to hold out or no di to not be hit by the fsmash. 
[[Marth upthrow in the corner]] can be used to enhance this mixup. If you upthrow in the corner, and they hold out you can down air spike them. 
This combination makes no di the safest option vs marth throw in the corner.

At higher percents ~90% fthrow and di in can lead to a tipper dsmash.
