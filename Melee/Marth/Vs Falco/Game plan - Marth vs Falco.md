When  you get a grab in the corner you can get potentially really big punishes based on their di. On [[Marth upthrow in the corner|di out]] you can up throw and then down air them after, which is most likely a kill or a edge guard at least. When they [[Marth fthrow in the corner|di in]] you can forward smash them which will often kill.
