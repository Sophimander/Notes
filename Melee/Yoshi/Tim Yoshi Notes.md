Day 1 (HUGE THOUGHTS MIGHT LAST A WHILE): I had a big struggle today on what moves to use in a macro sense. Kinda like I didn't know what could zone vs approach with vs bait with. Straight up had a trial and error process on everything until I landed on the conclusion that (on a macro scale):

- Bair is your priority approaching move when closing space. Walls okay.
- Nair is your strongest approaching tool when really close and tracking down rolls/applying pressure. Don't use from far away lol.
- Fair is your #1 walling tool to just spam with drift back and they now have to respect your space.
- Uair is like really really good but I am so ass at moving with DJC up air LOL. Your best sharking tool by a significant margin due to how mobile you are getting to and from. Huge kill potential too.
- Dair is your coming down tool that you use with DJ and edgecancel mixups. Kinda bad but you can get some nasty plat pressure sequences with it.

Tilts:

- Utilt is so sick at just sharking underneath the opponent. Kinda like a spacie up tilt highkey, very fast and has super strong priority (and combos lmfao).
- Ftilt is sick when you're doing it in a tech chase, if not, it's a little tricky. Using UAFT works to sorta cover you from above (up tilt usually better), but it's a tossup.
- Dtilt is soooooo good at zoning the ground. Love that it knocks down super early too. Got some cool early kills with it.

The smash attacks I have thoughts on but I'm not entirely sure yet. I think more than anything, I had the best time getting my ass kicked. Haven't felt big problem solving moments in this game in a while lmaoo. I just felt like I figured so many things out and came up with things on the spot that I'll use later. Sick day, gonna get better and prob write less in the future but I'm bored and high ROFL.

I think the biggest thing I tried to work on yesterday was controlling my drift from the double jump. Itâ€™s insane the amount of space you can cover and how quickly you can get down.

   - SH DJC no fastfall gives max length drift away or towards your opponent
   - SH DJC delayed fastfall with drift cuts it like half way
   - SH DJC immediate fastfall puts you really close to where you started jumping
   
The longest distance drift could close in space with a bair or fair (shit at doing it with fair lol). The mid distance I feel is good for zoning and keeping space while setting up a bit of a wall. The instant fast fall is really good for pressure I feel.
These were some of the big things I came up with
